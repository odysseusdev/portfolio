## Overview

A web application for viewing rooms and tracking players currently playing ZPL's Mario Kart Wii mod, [Retro Rewind](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Retro_Rewind).

## Background

Like many growing up in the 2000's and 2010's, the Nintendo Wii was a staple for any and all interactive party entertainment. Alongside the iconic **Wii Sports** (and an unusual love for **Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2009** of all things), **Mario Kart Wii** sat proudly at the top as the pinnacle of competitive social gameplay.

The game provided endless laughs, frustration and close finishes, and showcased the unbearably frustrating **Wii motion controls** that were once revolutionary for its time. The competitive scene flourished, particularly with **CTGP** providing custom tracks and longevity to the online servers.

Like all popular online multiplayer game franchises though, new releases will slowly steal away the player base in favour of fresh content on more advanced hardware. Mario Kart Wii's community continued to plod along, but my copy of the game began collecting dust on the shelf.

## Retro Rewind

Recently however, my interest was piqued by a new distribution **Retro Rewind**, with a focus on high-quality retro custom tracks and improved gameplay.

Setup was extremely easy, thanks to the wonderful work of the devs of **Wheel Wizard**, and within minutes I was in a room with 11 other **Funky Kong Flame Runners** on some of my favourite retro tracks. If you grew up with **Mario Kart Wii** like I did, I highly recommend checking out the links below and giving it a crack.

The distribution has gathered a consistent player base, with it now being very rare to struggle to find a full room.

## Development

Like many of the personal web application projects I've undertaken, **Retro Rewind · Players & Rooms** stemmed from a desire to learn and develop, rather than a real-world need or tangible use case. Others in the community, including the devs of **Wheel Wizard**, have already provided players with a way to view who is currently online and who is in what room.

When Next.js migrated to their new **App Router** and adopted React's new **Server Components**, I'd already moved on to learning other frameworks and libraries, such as **Sveltekit**.

With an easily accessible active rooms API, this web application felt like an easy gateway project into learning Next.js's new ways of developing, as well as Mantine's recent adoption of the **Styles API**.

Hence this simple web application was born..
