## Overview

A web application that serves as the home/landing page for the **[odysseusdev.app](https://odysseusdev.app)** domain.

## Background

I mean there's not much to say here..

I bought a custom domain to host all my personal web application projects, and needed a landing page for the root **[odysseusdev.app](https://odysseusdev.app)** domain.

Pretty fun stuff..

## Development

It could have just been a single page that said something cheesy like "Hey, this is my domain", but I thought I may as well take the opportunity to speak about each of the projects in more depth.

I also always really liked the simple monotone color scheme that inspired UI libraries such as **shadcn** and **TailwindUI**, and thought I'd take the opportunity to explore and play around with a similar theme.
